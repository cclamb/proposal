\section*{$\phi$ --- Single Guard, No Policies}
\begin{itemize}
\item NSA and BAH models here
\begin{itemize}
\item NSA two domains with filter chains
\item BAH filter segment evaluates data between interface segments
\end{itemize}
\item Usually one domain more sensitive than the other
\begin{itemize}
\item need-to-know
\item not always, sometimes compartmented data just can't be mixed
\end{itemize}
\item rules tightly coupled to filter implementations, filters need to know \textit{specific information} about content
\end{itemize}

\section*{$\alpha$ --- Single Guard, Policy Integration}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ratheon and NSA SOA models here
\begin{itemize}
\item Both use explicit policies to guide decisions
\end{itemize}
\item at least two domains, could have more
\item separating obligations, permissions, constraints gives flexibility
\item filters can be more generic, supporting policies defined with a specific ontology
\item more flexible
\begin{itemize}
\item rules now described in policies that accompany content
\item guards no longer need to know how specific content can be used \textit{a priori}
\item just need to understand a fairly static metamodel, then get specifics from policies
\item e.g. here guard knows that content may have expiration dates; in $\phi$ guard needs to know the expiration data \textit{a priori}
\end{itemize}
\item easier to manage, maintain
\item policies can be referenced via URI or packaged with content directly
\item first external service, others can exist
\end{itemize}

\section*{$\beta$ --- Router Guards}
\begin{itemize}
\item Using overlays, but could be implemented in physical elements or SDN-like systems
\item Each domain hosts network, could be degenerate of one node
\item Content evaluation at routing points
\item Some traffic easier than others
\begin{itemize}
\item HTTP easier than TCP
\end{itemize}
\item More security in depth
\item Can create compartments under specific routers (ad-hoc creation!); beginnings of multi-tenancy
\end{itemize}

\section*{$\gamma$ --- Router and Node Guards}
\begin{itemize}
\item Integrated with routers and nodes
\item evaluate at all levels; emitting requests, fielding requests, and in between
\item Single node compartments possible
\item more security in depth
\end{itemize}

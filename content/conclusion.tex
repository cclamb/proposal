\begin{beamerboxesrounded}[shadow]{Contribution of Work}
The unique contribution of this work is a quantitative analysis of policy-centric overlay network options, associated taxonomies of use, and prototypical technology proofs-of-concept.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Overlay Options} --- This includes various types of overlay networks and associated strengths and weaknesses addressing centralized and decentralized models
\item \textit{Taxonomies of Use} --- Depending on the specific usage management requirements and context, different overlays have different applicability; this work will provide guidance on suitability
\item \textit{Prototypical Technologies} --- Examples and proofs-of-concept will be required to appropriately analyze various architectural alternatives
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Expensive} --- They do not use current commercial resources and use costly partitioning schemes
\pause
\item \textit{Unreliable} --- Too reliant on outmoded security approaches
\pause
\item \textit{Slow} --- Information is manually reviewed too often leading to the right people being unable to get the right information in time 
\end{itemize}

\textit{They need to be re-imagined to take advantage of radical shifts in computational provisioning.}

Distributed enterprise computing systems are facing a troubling future.  They are:
\pause
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Expensive} --- They do not use current commercial resources and use costly partitioning schemes
\pause
\item \textit{Unreliable} --- Too reliant on outmoded security approaches
\pause
\item \textit{Slow} --- Sensitive information is manually reviewed too often leading to the right people being unable to get the right information in time 
\end{itemize}
\
\newline
\pause
They need to be re-imagined to take advantage of radical shifts in computational provisioning.

\textit{Federal computer systems are a prime example of these kind of problematic distributed systems, and demonstrate the difficulty in implementing new technical solutions.}
